### Abstract
French schooling is often the focus of attention when it comes to issues of inequality. The middle school in particular is often criticized and is subject to reforms that attempt to reduce inequalities and what is called school segregation. It is precisely in middle school that the choice of the modern languages that students will study throughout their schooling takes place. It is noted that certain languages are socially marked. Many sociological field analyses or descriptive surveys have shown that the choice of certain languages can appear as a class strategy. Few econometric studies have been carried out in this sense and the objective of this work is to determine quantitatively whether a student's CSP has an impact on his/her choice. We focused on the choice distinction between German and Spanish. We show that positive effects are noted between the choice of german over spanish when more higher csp chose german. However, this study was not sufficient to explain all the parameters that make up student choice.
